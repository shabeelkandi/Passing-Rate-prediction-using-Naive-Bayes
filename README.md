# Passing-Rate-prediction-using-Naive-Bayes
Predict the passing rate of a selected individual for a driving test in the UK, using Naive Bayes.

# Case Profile
XYZ is a student from LSE with the profile pseudo-randomly generated using the R function XYZprofile (with the argument being the numerical value of a 9-digit number of the format 2017*****

# Problem Description
XYZ has been learning driving for some time, and is thinking of taking the practical car test in UK
There are two sensible options for XYZ:
1. either take the practical test at the nearest test centre to his/her home;
2. or take it at the nearest test centre to the LSE.
Note that in XYZ’s generated profile, the entry “Home address” actually gives the name of the nearest test driving test centre to XYZ’s home. In addition, the test centre closest to the LSE is Wood Green (London).

XYZ thinks his/her driving skill is about average. It is widely believed that the driving test routes around some centres are probably more difficult than others (e.g. there are far less bus lanes, roundabouts and cyclists in rural areas than in London).

1. What is XYZ’s expected passing rate at the nearest test centre to his/her home?
2. What is XYZ’s expected passing rate at the nearest test centre to the LSE?
3. Of these two locations, where should XYZ take the test? Is there any evidence to (statistically)
support this suggestion?

This problem was solved using the Naive Bayes classification principles which are further outlined in the Methodology Report.
